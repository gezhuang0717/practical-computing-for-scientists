## Course Synopsis

This course will focus on breaking scientific problems into algorithmic pieces that can be solved using computational methods. Root finding, linear and non-linear equations, numerical modeling, optimization, random processes, graphical data presentation and fitting, scientific documentation preparation.

## Objectives

The primary purpose of this course is to give you the tools you need to solve scientific problems in your future courses and after graduation. In particular you will learn how to frame a problem, break it up into algorithmic pieces, implement the solution in computer code, and evaluate the results you obtain.

## Class Meetings

Each week we will have two interactive lectures (Monday and Wednesday in Small Hall 111) and one short lecture/lab (Friday in Small Hall 122). The goal of the short lecture/lab on Fridays is to let you go through programming exercises while I can help you with questions.

## Blackboard

I will use blackboard only for announcements. This ensures that everyone who is currently enrolled in the class has access to the relevant information. Make sure you check your blackboard announcements regularly or have it setup to notify you by email.

## Suggested Resources

All necessary resources for this course are available online, though not always in a single place. You will be able to complete this course without any required textbooks. Nevertheless, the following two resources may be very useful:
- Practical Computing for Biologists, Haddock and Dunn, ISBN 9780878933914, 9781605354118
- Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3, Kiusalaas, ISBN 9781107033856

The first book targets a broad range of scientists (not just biologists) and is exactly what I think should be in this course. It is not merely a programming book.

The second book introduces various numerical algorithms. It provides the connection between the algebra and calculus and the programming implementation.

## Python

While I will not assume that you have experience in programming from scratch, I will assume that you know how to read programs and have a basic understand of various data types, loops and conditionals.

Although much of what you will learn in this class will be useful independent of programming language, practical consideration force us to make a choice. We will be using python as the programming language for this course.

If you wish to brush up your python knowledge or see what we are going to start from, I encourage you to take one of the many python tutorials online (e.g. https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science). We will begin with fairly basic python and throughout the semester we will naturally start using more advanced concepts in python.

Python has a few advantages:
- Python is a general purpose programming language that is widely used in industry and at national and international research laboratories.
- Python is free and will be available after you graduate from William & Mary.
- Any modules and extension of python that we will use in this course are open source and allow you to dig in and figure out what is going on.
- Python is easy to learn and use (and indeed taught in the computer science department at William & Mary).
- Python has a large user community and very good documentation.

## Homework

Homework will be assigned by Thursday evening each week and will be due the following Wednesday at 11:59 pm.

Each homework assignment will be assigned to a two-person group, randomly selected each week. You are allowed to talk to other groups, but *not* to copy code or documentation.

## Course Schedule

## Exams

There will be a take-home final exam. In contrast to the homework assignments, you are expected to solve this final exams on your own. The final exam will be due on the date an in-class final exam would be scheduled.

## Evaluation

The total grade will be calculated from your homework grades (50%), the final exam (25%), and your report and presentation (25%).

## Letter Grades

The letter grades will be according to the following table:

|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| A- [90%,93%[ | A [93%,100%] |              |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| B- [80%,83%[ | B [83%,87%[  | B+ [87%,90%[ |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| C- [70%,73%[ | C [73%,77%[  | C+ [77%,80%[ |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| D- [60%,63%[ | D [63%,67%[  | D+ [67%,70%[ |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|              | F [0%,60%[   |              |

## Absence

Notify the instructor in advance if you will be missing class or homework.

## Accommodations

It is the policy of The College of William \& Mary to accommodate students with disabilities and qualifying diagnosed conditions in accordance with federal and state laws. Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a learning, psychiatric, physical or chronic health diagnosis should contact the Student Accessibility Services staff at 757-221-2509 or at \href{mailto:sas@wm.edu}{sas@wm.edu}. SAS staff will work with you to determine if accommodations are warranted, and if so, to help you obtain an official letter of accommodation. For more information please see \href{http://www.wm.edu/sas}{Student Accessibility Services}.

If you feel that there is anything that I can do to ensure a better learning environment for you, please do not hesitate to contact me. As long as these ad-hoc accommodations do not unfairly disadvantage other students, I am more than willing to help out.

## Auditing

Students are welcome to audit this course (i.e. participate not for credit). Since one only learns by doing, students who audit this course are strongly encouraged to hand in homework assignments as well as midterm and final take-home exams. Although you will not be graded on them, you are expected to make a good faith effort as you would for other courses.
