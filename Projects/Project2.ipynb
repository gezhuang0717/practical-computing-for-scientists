Put a satellite in circular orbit at some radius ([geostationary orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit), for example). Compute its velocity from balancing acceleration due to gravity with centrifugal. Establish initial conditions and see if your function, in conjunction with the in-class `vsolve_rk4` or `scipy.integrate.odeint`, can give back the correct orbit. __Note this ever recurring pattern.

You might consider testing it out by defining a 3*N element 1D array and then using `reshape` to convert it into a (N,3) 2D array.  "
