Plot the ball's trajectory. How far away does the ball land? Estimate by zooming in and eyeballing. Note, the drag force is still dependent on $v^2 = v_x^2 + v_y^2$ but the direction of the force has components opposing the motion in both x and y. If you are confused, do the problem first without any drag at all and make sure you get the PHYS 101 answer."
